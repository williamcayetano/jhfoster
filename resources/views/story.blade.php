		    		<h2 class="default-headline">THE JOURNEY OF JOHN HENRY FOSTER - 1905</h2>
		    		<p class="default-paragraph">John Henry Foster, born in Rhode Island, was a "pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps" kind of entrepreneur. He was a born salesman and an even better friend to all who knew him. With an abundance of charisma, charm and business intuition, he took his vision of becoming a businessman and turned it into a successful, long-standing industrial distributorship, now employing over 170 employees and going into its 75th year. John Henry passed away in 1986 but his memory lives on in all the lives touched by his graciousness, ambition and his vision.</p>

		    		<h2 class="default-headline">A MAN WITH A VISION - 1928</h2>
		    		<p class="default-paragraph">John Henry Foster began his career, selling pneumatic equipment out of an Airstream Trailer. The trailer, filled with working displays of his products, was pulled behind his old, black Cadillac. John Henry drove south in the winter and north in the summer, calling on industrial manufacturers, making a lasting impression with his distinctive sales approach. “You can’t sell from an empty wagon” was more than just his favorite saying, it was John Henry Foster’s way of taking care of business as a traveling manufacturer’s representative. He took pride in having what his customers needed, when they needed it.</p>
